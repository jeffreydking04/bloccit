Assignment 33-Questions Resource

Two days later and I am back on the hunt.  I opened up the project in Cloud 9 yesterday, wrote some code, started the server to make sure I was getting the right results and got a path error from Cloud 9 again.  

I am very certain I did nothing to corrupt my path and that this was a Cloud 9 problem, not a jdking problem (my code worked fine when I cloned it to a new project).  It was the second time that it had happened. 

In addition, Cloud 9 did not respond when I contacted them.  I know I am not a paying customer, but guess what? One day I am going to be a professional developer and I will not be using Cloud 9 because they did not have the time for me when I was using their free service.  

I am pretty certain that the fix would have been fairly easy if I knew where Cloud 9 kept all their files.  I think they have a bug related to the path and their local host and I would just need to reconnect the project with the url (I know I really do not know what I am talking about here, but my google searches led me to believe that a simple edit to the PATH would fix it).

In any case, I decided to use a USB stick to set up a bootable Linux environment.  I got it up and running and chose Linux Mint because it was recommended as the best linux distrobution for desktop by some random site that I do not recall the name of. 

I found out after installing it that Linux Mint had a security breach back in February, but that was addressed.  Linux Mint is supposed to have a extremely enthusiastic community, which is helpful when problems arise.  

So far the experience has been good.  I was able to get rvm, sublime (I am so glad to be back in the sublime editor), ruby, and rails up and running.  I get better at googling the process to fix the inevitable error messages you get when trying to set everything up.

For example: ubuntu (of which linux mint is a derivative) has security features which inhibit certain kinds of global commands (I think).  There is a command with rvm (ruby version control package) that sets the default ruby version, but ubuntu will not let that run.  Googling the issue led me to a fix which led to the standard install instructions working like a charm.  

To make a long story less long, I managed to clone my project in the new environment and I am now up and running on the Linux OS with the most important applications (mail, skype, slack, my homepage) set up for easy access.  

It feels good to have everything be truly local.  I am not very trusting of cloud resources and I am glad to be done with it.  This will also allow me to use brackets as my html/css editor.  Brackets looks really nice.  With an IDE like Cloud 9, you are pretty much stuck with their editors.  Now I can jump around to whatever editor best suits my task.

The above will go in as a blog entry, but onward with the project log.  I am writing the questions assignment and feeling good.

It is a few hours later.  Still learning to get around in the new environment, but I am liking it more and more.  The questions resource assignment was pretty easy.  I can write pretty much everything except a few of the tests and some of the html without consulting the previous work.  

The only new item in the assignment was working with a checkbox, but that just required another div in the form with f.label :resources and f.check_box :resources.  Easy enough
